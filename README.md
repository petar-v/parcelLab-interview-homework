ParcelLab interview homework

# How to run

In order to start the application, run the following command:

```
yarn start
```

This should start a server running on port `3000`.

# Note

I will take down this repository once I get some final feedback for my application. This is so that other people won't copy. :)

Looking forward to you feedback!
